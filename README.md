## üõ†Ô∏è Code Structure and Technical Breakdown

This project demonstrates strong front-end development capabilities by integrating structure, style, and behavior across three main files.

### 1. Code Functionality (Behavior Layer)

The inclusion of **`script.js`** elevates this project from a static template to an interactive web element.

| File | Primary Function | Technical Skill Demonstrated |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`script.js`** | Manages the **mobile menu state**. It listens for a click event on the hamburger icon and toggles an active class (e.g., `.nav-open`) on the main navigation element. | **DOM Manipulation** and handling **user events** using clean Vanilla JavaScript. |
| **`style.css`** | Defines the visual appearance for the **menu transition** (e.g., using `transform: translateX()` or `opacity`) when the active class is added by JavaScript. | **CSS Transitions** and managing complex element states. |

### 2. Primary Page Sections

The **`index.html`** file includes crucial landing page sections:

* **Hero Section:** The initial, high-impact view with a clear value proposition and primary CTA.
* **Features/Benefits:** Detailed blocks explaining the service offerings (e.g., pricing, guarantee, support).
* **How It Works:** A clear, simple process guide.
* **Footer:** Contains navigation links, social media icons, and copyright information.
